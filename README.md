# Temperature-and-Humidity-Monitoring-and-Notification-System
Temperature and humidity monitoring and notification system is an academic coursework project designed to measure and monitor physical conditions of humidity and temperature in a given environment. Along with humidity and temperature, an Ultrasonic sensor has been used for the detection of water level depth and similarly, soil
moisture has been monitored and recorded too. For the notification part of the system, a buzzer device has been used to notify about exceeded thresholds. Along with this, the system uploads data to the cloud using an open-source API known as ThingSpeak. 

The overall application of the system is focused on agriculture-based operations.
With physical constraints of the environment recorded, uploaded, and accordingly notified to the users, the system is focused solely on improving the experience of this
process in all dynamics to advance the agricultural system of Nepal.
